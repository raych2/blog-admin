# Blog Admin
_TOP Blog Admin_ consumes data from [Blog API](https://rt-blog-api.herokuapp.com/posts). Authenticated users can create, edit, publish, and delete blog posts. Also, they can delete individual comments or all comments (only when the blog post is deleted).  The project guidelines are listed in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/blog-api) Node.js curriculum.
